 # JavaScript Assignment 2

### Overview

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

### Before You Begin

1. Create a GitHub repo called `TriviaGame`, then clone the repo to your computer.

2. Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
3. Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

4. Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
5. Inside `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`

   * In your `css` folder, create a `style.css` file.
   * In your `javascript` folder, create an `app.js` file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
   * In your `images` folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

6. Choose a game to build from your options below.
